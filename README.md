# ðŸ“ƒ Malicious IP Address List

This repository contains a list of various IP addresses associated with different malicious activities on the network.
Most of them are part of botnets used to carry out cyberattacks, such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.

Some of these IP addresses have been or are still being used to generate artificial traffic on websites.
Such activities can deceive analytics systems, generate fake ad clicks, and more.
Highly recommended if you are using Google AdSense.

### Usage

- Blocking malicious IP addresses on firewalls.
- Analyzing threats and identifying suspicious network traffic.
- Protecting against DDoS attacks and other network threats.

### Warning
Blocking IP addresses should be done carefully to avoid blocking legitimate traffic.
It is recommended to update the list regularly.
