# ðŸ“ƒ Malicious IP Address List
This repository contains a list of IP addresses associated with various malicious activities on the network.
Many of these addresses are part of botnets used to conduct cyberattacks, such as DDoS attacks.

Some of these IP addresses have been, or are still being, used to generate artificial traffic on websites.
Such activities can mislead analytics systems, inflate ad click counts, and more. This list is particularly useful for those using services like Google AdSense.

### Usage
This list can be useful for network administrators, security researchers, and cybersecurity companies. It can help with:
- Blocking malicious IP addresses in firewalls.
- Analyzing threats and detecting suspicious network traffic.
- Defending against DDoS attacks and other network-related threats.

### Warning
Blocking IP addresses should be done with caution to avoid disrupting legitimate traffic.
Regular updates to the list are recommended.

## Cron
The list is refreshed every 2 hours.
